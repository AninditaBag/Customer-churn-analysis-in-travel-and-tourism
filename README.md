# Customer-churn-analysis-in-travel-and-tourism
A travel company wants to predict whether its customers will churn based on indicators like age, frequent flyer information, annual income, and services used. This project is focused on predicting customer churn for a tour and travels company. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company's services. In this case, we want to predict when a customer might stop booking tours with our company.

Tour and travels companies depend on customer loyalty for repeat business. If a customer stops using the company's services, it can be costly to acquire a new customer to replace them. By predicting customer churn, a company can take proactive steps to retain customers and prevent them from leaving.
